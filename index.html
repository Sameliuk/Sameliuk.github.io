        <h3>My favourite city</h3>
        <p>
            Prague is one of the most beautiful cities I have ever visited. It
            is famous for its stunning medieval architecture, narrow cobblestone
            streets, and the magical atmosphere of the Old Town. The Charles
            Bridge, with its historic statues, offers a wonderful view of the
            Vltava River, while Prague Castle impresses with its size and
            history. Walking through the city, you can feel a mix of old
            traditions and modern life. Prague is a place that leaves
            unforgettable memories and makes you want to return again.
